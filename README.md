# Software Project
This repository contains three distinct projects developed as part of the "Software Project" course at Tel Aviv University. Each project delves into various clustering algorithms, with a focus on the K Means and its extensions.

## Introduction
Software Project course provided an opportunity to explore and implement advanced algorithms in the realm of data clustering. Through hands-on projects, we delved deep into the intricacies of clustering algorithms, their optimizations, and real-world applications.

## Project Descriptions
### Project 1: K Means in C and Python
In this project, we implemented the K Means clustering algorithm from scratch. The algorithm was developed in both C and Python, providing a comparative perspective on performance and ease of implementation in different programming paradigms.

### Project 2: K Means++ and C API Integration
Building on the foundation of the first project, we implemented the K Means++ algorithm in Python. This enhanced version of K Means ensures a smarter initialization of centroids. A significant portion of this project was dedicated to integrating the K Means algorithm (from Project 1) using the C API. This allowed us to bridge our C implementation with Python, leveraging the power of both languages. Additionally, we utilized external packages like Numpy and Pandas to enhance the functionality and efficiency of our implementation.

### Project 3: symNMF and Clustering Analysis
In the final project, we ventured into the domain of matrix factorization to implement a clustering algorithm based on symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (symNMF). After implementing the algorithm, we applied it to various datasets, analyzing the clustering results and drawing insights. A comparative study was also conducted where we juxtaposed the results of symNMF with the K Means algorithm, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
